1. __A group of college students.__

    In this informal study, the treatment variable is the consumption of herbal
    tea. The students are the experimenters and are treating the residents of
    the nursing homes, their subjects, with herbal tea. The response variable
    is the change in residents' wellbeing (specifically, their cheerfulness and
    apparent good health). This is the variable of prime interest in the study.
    However, the study also offers opportunities for the residents to meet
    young, bright college students who are interested in their wellbeing.
    Social interaction can influence the cheerfulness and health of the
    residents, so this is an example of a confounding variable. The experiment
    is fundamentally flawed because the students did not establish a controlled
    environment with randomized treatment groups.

2. __An article entitled “The Science of Polling” in *Newsweek*__ (<time datetime="1992-09-28">September 28, 1992</time>).

    The pollsters encountered nonresponse bias and coverage error. If indeed
    Republicans were less likely to answer the pollster's phone call on Friday
    nights, then there are likely other undiscovered instances of nonresponse
    bias plaguing the results. The samples taken are not representative of the
    population. Furthermore, phone polling equates the voting population with
    the population of landline owners. Anyone who does not own a telephone
    would have a zero probability of being surveyed. While this may not have
    been significant in 1992, it would certainly bias the results today.

3. __During World War II.__

    The engineers' sampling design was susceptible to survivorship bias, which
    one can interpret as a coverage or sampling error. By selecting "a large
    sample of battle-proven airplanes" or "a sample of returning planes," there
    is a zero probability that a fallen aircraft would be included in the
    sample. The sample is not at all representative of the population.

    Abraham Wald's "odd" conclusion redefines the population as the set of all
    planes assumes that survived, making the sample representative of the
    population. If many returning aircraft had holes in a specific place, then
    aircraft tend to survive holes there. Therefore, Wald advises reinforcing
    areas with uncommon holes since the data don't indicate that aircraft tend
    to survive holes in those areas.
