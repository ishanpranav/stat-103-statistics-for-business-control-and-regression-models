\section{Learning the mechanics}
\begin{enumerate}
\item See below.

\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\item\[s^2_{x,y}=\sum^{n-1}_{i=0}{(x_i-\bar{x})(y_i-\bar{y})}\approx -26.2857\dots\]
\item\[s^2_x=\sum^{n-1}_{i=0}{(x_i-\bar{x})^2}\approx 33.7143\dots\]
\item\[b_1=\frac{s^2_{x,y}}{s^2_x}\approx -0.7797\dots\]
\item\[\bar{x}\approx 3.4286\dots\]
\[\bar{y}\approx 4.4286\dots\]
\item\[\bar{y}=b_1\bar{x}+b_0.\]

\[b_0=\bar{y}-b_1\bar{x}\approx 7.1017\dots\]
\item\[\hat{y}=b_1x+b_0=-0.7797x+7.1017.\]
\end{enumerate}
\section{Forecasting movie revenues with Twitter}
\[b_1=0.078767\dots\]
Assuming that movie revenue and tweet rate are linearly related, we estimate a movie's opening weekend revenue increases by an average of 7,876,700 dollars as the tweet rate for the movie increases by an average of 100 tweets per hour.
\section{Congress voting on women's issues}
Let $y$ represent a legislator's American Association of University Women score as a function of the number of daughters ($x$) that the legislator has.

\[y_i=\beta_1x_i+\beta_0+\epsilon_i.\]

\begin{enumerate}
\item If it is true that having a daughter influences voting on women's issues, the sign of $\beta_1$ will be positive. A positive linear coefficient ($\beta_1$) indicates a positive linear relationship.
\item
\[n=434.\]
\[\nu=n-2=432.\]
\[b_1=0.27.\]
\[s_{b_1}=0.74.\]
\[t^*=F^{-1}_{432}(0.025)\approx 1.9655\dots\]

We can be ninety-five-percent confident that the true value of $\beta_1$ is in the interval:
\[(-1.18,1.72)\]

\end{enumerate}
\section{RateMyProfessors.com}
Let $y$ represent the student evaluation of teaching and $x$ represent the RateMyProfessors.com rating.
\[n=426.\]
\[r_{x,y}=0.68.\]
\begin{enumerate}
\item
\[r_{x,y}=\frac{s^2_{x,y}}{s_xs_y}=\frac{b_1s_x}{s_y}.\]
\[b_1=\frac{r_{x,y}s_y}{s_x}.\]

\[\hat{y}=(0.68)\left(\frac{s_y}{s_x}\right)+b_0.\]
\item The sample correlation of 0.68 indicates a strong positive linear relationship between the RateMyProfessors.com rating and the student evaluation of teaching. Students who rate their professors highly on RateMyProfessors.com also tend to give high evaluations of teaching.
\item The estimated slope of the line is positive. A positive sample correlation indicates a positive linear relationship.
\item There is convincing evidence, at the 0.1\% significance level, that RateMyProfessors.com ratings and student evaluations of teaching are correlated.
\item\[r^2\approx 0.46.\]

Approximately 46 percent of the variation in student evaluations of teaching can be explained by variations in RateMyProfessors.com ratings using a least-squares regression line.
\end{enumerate}
\section{Data on pricing of ladies' diamond rings}
\[n=48.\]
\[\nu=n-2=46.\]
\[b_1=3721.0.\]
\[s_{b_1}=81.8.\]
\begin{enumerate}
\item Based on the scatterplot of price and weight, a linear regression model appears very appropriate. The data resemble a straight line.

\caption{Scatterplot of price (vertical) and weight (horizontal).}

\end{figure}
\item\[y_i=\beta_1x_i+\beta_0+\epsilon_i.\]
\[y_i=b_1x_i+b_0+e_i.\]
\[\hat{y}=(\$3721.00)x-(\$259.60).\]
\item Yes, there is evidence of a significant linear relationship between the price and the weight of a diamond. The weight coefficient ($\beta_1$) has a Student $t$-statistic of $-14.99$, with a $P$-value of approximately 0.0000. This probability is statistically significant even at the 0.01 percent significance level ($\alpha=0.0001$), indicating that it is very unlikely statistic that the null hypothesis ($H_0:\beta_1=0$) is true. Therefore, there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis and conclude in favor of the alternative hypothesis ($H_1:\beta_1\neq 0$), that there is in fact a linear relationship between a diamond's price and its weight.
\item On average, for each additional caret a diamond weighs, its price is about \$3721.00 more expensive.
\[t^*=F^{-1}_{46}(0.025)\approx 2.0129\dots\]

We can be ninety-five-percent confident that the true value of $\beta_1$ is in the interval:
\[(\$3556.35,\$3885.65)\]
\item Approximately 97.83 percent of the variation in diamond prices can be explained by variations in diamond weight using a least-squares regression line.
\item\begin{align*}
s_e
&=\sqrt{\frac{1}{\nu_e}\sum^{n-1}_{i=0}{[y-y_i]}}\\
&=\sqrt{\frac{1}{n-2}\sum^{n-1}_{i=0}{[y-y_i]}}\\
&\approx\sqrt{1014}\\
&\approx 31.84\dots
\end{align*}
\item\[H_0:\beta_1=\$3500.00.\]
\[H_1:\beta_0\neq\$3500.00.\]
\[\alpha=0.01.\]
\[t^*=F^{-1}_{46}(0.005)\approx 2.6870\dots\]
We can be ninety-nine-percent confident that the true value of $\beta_1$ is in the interval:
\[(\$3501.20,\$3940.80)\]
Since the value \$3500.00 lies within that interval, there is insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis at the one-percent significance level. We cannot conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the true slope is different from \$3500.00.
